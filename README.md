# Ludo-in-C-1st-sem-project-
The objective of the Ludo project is the implementation of a text-based version of the classic board game Ludo using the C programming language. Ludo is a popular strategy board game that involves moving tokens around a square board to reach a designated finish area. The project likely aims to recreate the game’s functionality, allowing players to roll dice, move their tokens based on the dice roll, and implement special rules for certain positions on the game board.
